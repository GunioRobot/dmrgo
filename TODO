Add multi-step jobs (map/reduce1/reduce2/...)
Fix names: s/M(ap)?R(educe)?// ?
Expose doMap/doReduce so callers can know what stage they need to prepare for?
Add ReduceFinal() ?
Add more status logging for full map/reduce code (behind -v ?)
Client mappers and reducers now need to be thread-safe.  How to make this easy?
