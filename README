dmrgo is a Go library to make writing programs using Hadoop's Streaming protocol easier.

It is partially based on ideas from Yelp's MrJob package for Python, but since
the Go is statically typed I've tried to make the API match more closely with
Hadoop's Java API.

The traditional "word count" example is in the examples directory.
